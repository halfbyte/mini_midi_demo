# Web MIDI demos

Written for the JSUnconf.eu 2015 presentation "Making Noise with Web Audio and Web MIDI"

All examples should work from local disk, so to run them, simply clone the Repo and open examples in your Browser.

## Browser Compatibility

The Web MIDI API is still pretty much a moving target so currently this only works in Chrome Canary (at least out of the box). As this was written in a hurry, I didn't try to make this running using [Chris' Web MIDI shim](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim).

## The Examples in Detail

### [minimal.html](minimal.html)

A minimal example on how to initialize the API and send and receive MIDI events.

### [monitor.html](monitor.html)

Open up the console and monitor incoming midi data. Good for debugging.

### [input.html](input.html)

A demo to drive the Web Audio API with MIDI

### [output.html](output.html)

A simple sequencer that drives any connected synthesizer.

### [canvas.html](canvas.html)
